OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "title": "SEO-friendly, emotionally resonant title",
  "meta_description": "<155 char SEO meta description>",

  "body": "<full markdown blog content>",
  "key_takeaways": ["Takeaway 1", "Takeaway 2", "Takeaway 3"]

WRITING STYLE RULES
1. Open with a scene — drop the reader into the moment, not a preamble
2. Use sensory details: sounds, smells, tastes, textures — not just visuals
3. Honest voice: share what went wrong, what surprised you, what you'd do differently
4. India-native language: use Indian words where they fit naturally — don't translate everything
5. Practical info woven in: costs, timings, transport details embedded naturally in the narrative
6. End with a specific, actionable recommendation — not a generic "you should visit!"
7. Structure: scene-opening → experience narrative → practical insights → personal reflection → CTA
8. Length: 600–1200 words for a day section; 1500–2500 for a full trip post
